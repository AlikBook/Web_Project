        The Louvre Museum, located in the heart of Paris, is one of the world's
        largest and most visited art museums. Established in 1793, it occupies
        the historic Louvre Palace and boasts a collection of over 380,000
        objects, with 35,000 on display. The museum's diverse collection spans
        from ancient civilizations to the 19th century, featuring masterpieces
        like the Mona Lisa, the Venus de Milo, and the Winged Victory of
        Samothrace. The iconic glass pyramid, designed by architect I. M. Pei
        and inaugurated in 1989, serves as the museum's main entrance and is a
        modern contrast to the classical architecture of the palace.

        renowned for its extensive collection of French art from 1848 to 1914.
        It includes an impressive array of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist
        masterpieces by artists such as Monet, Degas, Van Gogh, and Renoir. The
        Orsay Museum provides visitors with a unique opportunity to experience
